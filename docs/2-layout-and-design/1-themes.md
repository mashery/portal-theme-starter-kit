# Themes

We've built 3 starter themes to help you get up-and-running more quickly.

[Download the starter kit](https://github.com/mashery/portal-theme-starter-kit/archive/master.zip) and unzip it. The files for all three themes are in the `dist` folder. Pick the theme you like best.

**Prefer to bring your own favorite CSS boilerplate or framework instead?** That's totally cool! Use [Blackbeard's templating system](/docs/read/your_portal/layout_and_design/Templates) to customize the markup as needed.

## What's included?

Each theme includes a unique style and layout. They all include a collection of frequently requested features:

- Expand-and-collapse navigation menus on smaller screens.
- Optional [Stripe-like documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api).
- Accordion/show-and-hide content areas.
- Display the latest blog posts anywhere on your Portal.
- Responsive videos for great documentation on any device.
- Animated scrolling to anchor links.
- Multi-language support.
