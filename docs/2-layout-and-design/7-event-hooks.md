# Event Hooks

Blackbeard emits custom JavaScript events that you can hook into to run scripts and further customize your Portal.

Use `addEventListener()` on the `window` element to listen for Portal events.

```js
window.addEventListener('portalAfterRender', function (event) {
	alert('The Portal was rendered!');
}, false);
```

## Events

- `portalLoaded` runs after the Portal app is loaded but before it's been initialized.
- `portalBeforeInit` runs before the Portal is initialized.
- `portalAfterInit` runs after the Portal is initialized.
- `portalBeforeRender` runs before the Portal is rendered.
- `portalAfterRender` runs after the Portal is rendered.
- `portalBeforeRenderAjax` runs before an Ajax page load.
- `portalAfterRenderAjax` runs after an Ajax page load.
- `portalIODocsShowMethod` runs after an IO-Docs method is shown.
- `portalIODocsHideMethod` runs after an IO-Docs method is hidden.
- `portalIODocsShowEndpoint` runs after an IO-Docs endpoint is shown.
- `portalIODocsHideEndpoint` runs after an IO-Docs endpoint is hidden.


## Emitting your own custom events

Blackbeard also includes [a JavaScript API for emitting your own custom events](/docs/read/your_portal/layout_and_design/JavaScript_API#emitevent).

```js
// A simple event
m$.emitEvent('myCustomEvent');

// An event with Details
m$.emitEvent('anotherCustomEvent', {
	details: {
		something: 'a value',
		another: true,
		answer: 42
	}
});
```
