# Working with Modern JavaScript

Blackbeard is a dependency-free Portal platform running on modern JavaScript APIs. It's possible to build a beautiful, modern looking site without using bloated libraries like jQuery.

To push support all the way back to IE 9 without the need for [precompilers like Babel](https://babeljs.io/), Blackbeard uses [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) to extend modern functionality back to older browsers.

There's also an robust [JavaScript API](/docs/read/your_portal/layout_and_design/JavaScript_API) for handling many common tasks.
