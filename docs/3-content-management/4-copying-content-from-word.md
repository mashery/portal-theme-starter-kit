# Copying Content from Word

If you copy/paste content from MS Word or other word processing software into your Portal with TinyMCE enabled, it will include a bunch of hidden HTML and inline styles that will be hidden behind the scenes.

This often causes unexpected layout issues and visual design problems.

As a best practices, uncheck the box next to `Use TinyMCE` before copying your content in, or use a plain text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write your content instead.
