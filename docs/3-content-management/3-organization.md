# Organization

To create a piece of content, click on the folder you want to add it to, and then click the `Create new page in...` button.

## Nested Content

If you have a lot of content, you may benefit from creating content sections and subdirectories.

Click on the folder you want to add your content to, and click the `Create new folder in...` button. This will create a subsection for your content.

The item, displayed in the bold, is the landing page for that section. You can add subpages under it by clicking on the folder and then clicking the `Create new page in...` button.

While there is no limit to how deep you can nest content, any more than one or two levels of nesting becomes cluttered and confusing for your users.

## Reordering Content

You can rearrange the order of content by dragging and dropping it.

Click and hold the content you want to move, drag the content by moving your mouse where you want it to go, and then release.

Content can be reordered within its folder, but not moved in or out of it. For example, you cannot drag content from the `Documentation` folder into the `Custom Pages`, and you can't drag-and-drop content in or out of subdirectories.

If you need to move content to a new folder, you will need to create a new page and copy/paste the content.
